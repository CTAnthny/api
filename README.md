## Authentication
All requests must have an `Authorization` http header with `Bearer <your-token-here>`.

*for development environment only*

The bearer token is a JSON Web Token and can be easily generated by running:
```sh
rake token
```

Or, pipe it directly to your clipboard:

```sh
rake token | pbcopy
```
